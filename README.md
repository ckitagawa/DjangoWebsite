# DjangoWebsite
Personal Django-based website still in "beta" and unhosted as of yet. I will work on hosting/populating it over the next work term.

The goal of this project was to create an AngularJS SPA with Django as the backend for my own use. It also leverages Bootstrap and jQuery for UI elements and CSS transitions. This functionality is 
fully developed and content, including photos, can be published remotely via the dbapi written for Django. No content is uploaded here outside of some static files as I don't want to publish content to 
GitHub.

Note that this website does not build/run if downloaded as the security key has been removed and the database stripped out.   

To Dos:
- Host
- Populate Data
- Optimize/alter use of cookies
- Improve functionality on other browsers
- Optimize CSS and app.js
