# DjangoWebsite
Personal DjangoWebsite still in development and unhosted as of yet. No photos or other data is populated but everything works on a functional level. I will work on hosting/populating it over the next work term.

The goal of this project was to create an AngularJS SPA with Django as the backend. It also leverages Bootstrap and jQuery for UI elements and CSS transitions.

ToDos:
- Host
- Populate Data
- Optimize/alter use of cookies
- Improve functionality on other browsers
- Optimize CSS and app.js
